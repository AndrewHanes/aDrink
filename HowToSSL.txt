HowToSSL.txt for aDrink

Because drink doesn't currently have ssl support, 
I'm making a text file that describes the process 
of implementing it for when it is available.  Without 
this file it is likely that I will forget how I wanted 
to do it.


First, add the certificate used by drink to the 
list of trusted certificates on the android device.
This is necessary because the certificate for drink is 
self signed.

Settings -> Location & Security -> Manage Trusted Certificates

Use this:
http://developer.android.com/reference/org/apache/http/conn/ssl/SSLSocketFactory.html

Just make a trust store with the certificate used by drink 
and use SSLSocketFactory to get a SSLSocket, then connect
