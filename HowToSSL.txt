First, add the certificate used by drink to the 
list of trusted certificates on the android device

Settings -> Location & Security -> Manage Trusted Certificates

Use this:
http://developer.android.com/reference/org/apache/http/conn/ssl/SSLSocketFactory.html

Just make a trust store with the certificate used by drink 
and use SSLSocketFactory to get a SSLSocket, then connect
