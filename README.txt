Note:  This app is still a work in progress, it may mess up what is being 
purchased

This app is intended to allow a user to order items from the vending
machines at Computer Science House using their android phone.
It is mostly functional, but still needs some polishing.

This app currently does NOT use encryption.  Use it at your own risk.

To install:
	Connect phone to computer
	type adb install Drink_Main.apk
	done
