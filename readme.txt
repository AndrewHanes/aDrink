Drink_App

Note:  This app is still a work in progress

This app is intended to allow a user to order items from Big Drink at Computer Science House using their android phone.
At the moment the app can drop drinks, but needs a LOT of polishing to make it functional.  Other vending machines at 
CSH can also be used, currently by changing the URL from "drink.csh.rit.edu" to the URL of another machine.

Because Suday Protocol does not currently support SSL this app will not use ssl as of now.  Everything 
that is sent over the network with this app is unencrypted, so use it at your own risk.
